# Assignment 1

## About project

This was an assignment in the course 'Work methodologies for developers' as a part of the program Front End Developer at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm. We were given a project with a lot of broken, messy code and our mission was to refactor everything into a structured, working project. The requirements for the assignment are listed at the end of this document.

### About the app

The application shows information about the podcasts in SR's humor category, including cover photo, podcast title, description and a link to the program. It is possible to choose whether you want to view the site in light or dark mode. The data is retrieved from an API using axios.
